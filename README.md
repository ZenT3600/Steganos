# Steganos
## Hidden in Plain Sight
---
Welcome to **Steganos'** Github Repository. Steganos is a **Steganography** project that works by hiding text inside of images.

There are currently **2** modes:
- Blatant Mode: it works by adding colourful pixels to a black image. Not very subtle, but it can hold a lot of information
- Stegano Mode: operates on preexisting images. It modifies certain pixels of the image making them look plausible but still hiding information in them

### Installation:

- Clone the repository
- "python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt"
- Run GUI.py for the Graphical Interface or use one of the modes inside the Logic folder as a CLI interface
